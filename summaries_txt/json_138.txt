Recommendation to direct City Manager and all appropriate departments to update the City of Long Beach COVID-19 Data Dashboard to clearly reflect any data sets considered or utilized by our Health Officer in determining Health Orders to ensure transparency and clarity in the decision making process; Direct City Manager and appropriate staff to report back on our Cityâ€™s efforts to lobby our federal and state legislature for a robust community focused relief bill that would provide support to our neighbors who are out of work, the non-profits that have supported them, the small businesses that have been completely or partially shut down, and the cities and states that have provided the infrastructure for testing, response and resiliency; In addition, research and bring back to Council options to advocate for federal legislative action support deferment and forbearance of government backed, Small Business Association (SBA) loans in light of the fiscal impact to small businesses.
