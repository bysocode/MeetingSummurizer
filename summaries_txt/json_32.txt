Recommendation to refer to the Elections Oversight Committee to study the merits of developing an 11-member appointed citizen redistricting advisory commission to research and advise the City Council on the possible mid-decade and future redistricting processes.  The commission would be made up of Long Beach residents appointed by each Council District with two at-large appointees from the Mayor; and request the Elections Oversight Committee to report back to City Council within 90 days.
