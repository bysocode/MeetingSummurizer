Recommendation to request City Manager within 90 days to develop a Neighborhood Engagement and Community Communications Plan that outlines the City's existing internal and external communication channels and public affairs efforts; reports on past City-wide surveys or other feedback mechanisms on the prioritization and citizen/user satisfaction of existing City services; aligns departmental coordination and public outreach within one of the five stated priorities of the City Council; and specifies how staff aim to expand the scope, reach and effectiveness of public communication to increase transparency and strengthen levels of civic engagement in the years ahead.
