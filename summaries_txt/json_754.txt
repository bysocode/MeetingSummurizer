Recommendation to request the Senior Citizen Advisory Commission to create a report to review and explore the costs of restoring the former senior food programs and to discuss the connection to transportation, specifically related to any major changes that would have interrupted access from senior communities to former food program locations in the city; and Request City Manager to provide a verbal report back at a Council meeting in a presentation no later than 90 days regarding the senior meal program. Grant opportunities should be explored along with the possibility of the Health Department collaborating or leading the work since this is truly a health related issue.
