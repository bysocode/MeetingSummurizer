Recommendation to request that all youth under the age of seventeen (17) be admitted to Belmont Pool and other city pools for $1; Request City Manager report back on the costs to expand the Summer Fun program to include youth from other community centers throughout the City if the demand is there, therefore, increasing the number of kids that can use the Belmont pool for free; and Request further that City Manager explore with Long Beach Transit the possibility of a special bus or buses dedicated solely to taking people to and from Belmont pool similar to Los Angeles and Foothill Transit buses that take people to area beaches.
