Recommendation to request City Manager to: • Receive and file a report from the Long Beach Innovation Team on the Nuisance Motels Pilot Program; • Explore the feasibility of a citywide Nuisance Motel Ordinance that would hold property owners accountable for nuisance and criminal related activities, by accelerating administrative penalties and timelines on nuisance, crime-ridden motels throughout the City of Long Beach; and • Explore the feasibility of implementing a Motel Amortization Program in order to reduce over concentration and outdated uses along corridors, thus diminishing the use of motels as hubs for illegal activity.
