Recommendation to request City Manager and Pacific Gateway to complete a comprehensive study of what a "Local Hire/FSA" program would entail and return to City Council within 45 days.  The research for the study should be done with Long Beach community partners including faith based organizations, and non-profits working on these issues.  The report should also include an evaluation and feasibility on a job coordinator for the program.
