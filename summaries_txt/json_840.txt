Recommendation to request City Manager to report back in 60 days on the feasibility of directing Public Works, and/or other City staff to conduct an audit of utility wires throughout the City to identify maintenance needs and violations, as well as safety concerns in order to better address these issues with the utility providers and the California Public Utilities Commission.
