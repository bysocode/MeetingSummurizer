Recommendation to direct City Attorney to amend LBMC Chapters 5.53 and 5.55 to remove their sunset clauses thereby making Chapters 5.53 and 5.55 permanent; and Direct City Attorney to rewrite LBMC sections 5.53.010 and 5.55.010 to reflect that the purpose of the Cityâ€™s recall and retention ordinances (LBMC 5.53 and 5.55) is to ensure an equitable recovery from COVID-19 for Long Beach hotel and janitorial workers and to protect workers against the dangers posed by future pandemics, including future COVID-19 variants and surges, and to return with the amended ordinance within 7 days.
