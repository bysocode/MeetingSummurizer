# Whisper and RAG Project

This repository automates the transcription, summarization, and retrieval of audio data using OpenAI Whisper for transcription and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for querying past summaries. Summarization is powered by Ollama's custom LLM models.

## Features
- **Audio Transcription**: Transcribes audio files into text using Whisper.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans and segments the transcriptions for structured summarization.
- **Summarization**: Summarizes transcripts using Ollama's models.
- **RAG Pipeline**: Enables querying of previously generated summaries to extract insights.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
1. **Python**: Ensure Python 3.10 or later is installed.
2. **FFmpeg**: Required for audio file processing.
   - **Ubuntu/Debian**:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install ffmpeg
     ```
   - **MacOS (Homebrew)**:
     ```bash
     brew install ffmpeg
     ```
   - **Windows**:
     Download and add FFmpeg to your PATH: [FFmpeg Downloads](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

3. **Git**: Ensure Git is installed for cloning the repository.

4. **Ollama Server**: Required for running Ollama's LLM.
   - Download and install Ollama from [Ollama Downloads](https://ollama.com/download).
   - Once installed, start the server by running:
     ```bash
     ollama serve
     ```
   - Verify the server is running by navigating to [http://localhost:11434](http://localhost:11434) in your browser.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bysocode/MeetingSummurizer
   cd MeetingSummurizer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use the Project

### 1. **Audio Transcription**
Place your audio file (e.g., `2minssample.mp3`) in the project directory and run the transcription process:
```bash
python app.py
```

The application will:
1. Transcribe the audio file.
2. Clean and preprocess the transcript.
3. Generate a summarized version of the transcript using Ollama's LLM.
4. Save the summaries in the `summaries_txt` folder.

**Note**: Ensure the Ollama server is running before executing the script.

### 2. **RAG Pipeline**
The project supports querying past summaries using the RAG pipeline:
```bash
python app.py
```
This command will also:
- Build an index using summaries in the `summaries_txt` directory.
- Allow you to query the index for insights.

### 3. **Fine-Tuning Models**
To fine-tune models with your RAG documents:
1. Prepare your dataset in JSON format from the RAG directory.
2. Use the `rag_pipeline.py` to preprocess the data for training.
3. Fine-tune models using Hugging Face's Trainer API or similar frameworks.

## File Structure
- `whisperapp.py`: Handles transcription using Whisper.
- `preprocess_transcript.py`: Cleans and segments transcripts for further processing.
- `ollamaInterface.py`: Interacts with the custom LLM for summarization through the Ollama server.
- `rag_pipeline.py`: Implements the RAG pipeline for document indexing and querying.
- `app.py`: End-to-end script that ties all components together.
- `summaries_txt/`: Directory for storing generated summaries.
